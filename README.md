stardict2txt and info



stardict2txt.py from rongyi - https://gist.github.com/rongyi/ff2f8a1a82cddb2efc9239bb0d7ca78b

Python 3 version, original stardict2txt.py is Python 2 only (however python 3 version appears to be more robust, sorting works when ran under Python 3).


Tested with "GNU Collaborative International Dictionary of English" from http://build.koreader.rocks/download/dict/
